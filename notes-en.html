        #Using Scratch

        Scratch is a great tool for teaching coding concepts, and building fun and creative digital games. If you aren’t familiar with the program: great news! There are tons of free, online resources to get you started. Here are a few that we think are awesome:

        * Scratch <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/#resources">Educator Resources</a> (especially the <a href="https://cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__0c1805349a6fe15c01c668d3f8acd971__/pdfs/help/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf">Getting Started Guide</a>)
        * Google CS First <a href="https://www.cs-first.com/training/introduction-computer-science-and-scratch">Training Materials</a>

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Girls Learning Code workshop: Collaborative Game Production! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please go with another learner (or your parent/guaridan).
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it.
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a break mid-way through, when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

              <br>A: (e.g.) Two heads are better than one. The other person might have an idea to make the project even better. The other person can help catch mistakes and work with you to problem-solve. We can get more done in a shorter time when working with others. Etc...</td>

        #Tech Stations: Group 1

        * Review the checklist of what will be completed at this station
        * Pair learners and assign each pair a level number
        * Instruct each pair to create an account in scratch using the instructions on Slide 27
        * <strong>Have pairs record their login info for the next group</strong>
        * Quick Code-Along:
          * Open up Scratch, and click on “create” (top, left corner)
          * Point out the main elements: Stage, Sprites, and Scripts. Demonstrate how to drag and connect blocks
          * Give learners 2 minutes to click on blocks and explore
        * Follow the <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AQNH-EQUEVi8GGe_lpqPpLaNOU2F5Rx0u0srs5nB-k0">solution sheet</a></strong> as you lead the group in creating a working foundation, stopping right after "Falling Obstacles"
        * <strong>Tip</strong>: If the room is too loud - have learners leave their computers and come stand/sit right in front of the screen
        * If you run out of time, continue where you left off with the second group
        * Make sure everyone clicks on "SHARE" when they are finished (top, right corner)
        * Have learners add their projects to the studio (Go to "My Class" > Select studio > Add Projects) - See slide 28

        <br>
        #Tech Stations: Group 2

        * Review the checklist of what will be completed at this station
        * Pair learners and assign each pair a level number
        * Instruct learners to sign in with the logins recorded from the first group
        * Quick Code-Along: (in a blank project)
          * Open up Scratch, and click on “create” (top, left corner)
          * Point out the main elements: Stage, Sprites, and Scripts. Demonstrate how to drag and connect blocks
          * Give learners 2 minutes to click on blocks and explore
        * Show them how to continue a project using the instructions on Slide 32
        * Follow the <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AQNH-EQUEVi8GGe_lpqPpLaNOU2F5Rx0u0srs5nB-k0">solution sheet</a></strong> as you lead the group in continuing their levels, picking up where the last group left off, and completing as much of the checklist as you can.
        * <strong>Tip</strong>: If the room is too loud - have learners leave their computers and come stand/sit right in front of the screen


        <br>
        #Beta Testing

        * Get everyone's attention and have them wrap up what they are doing at their station
        * Use the slides to explain beta testing (see notes below)
        * Explain that we will be focused on playing/testing the levels - we might not have time to fix every bug, but it's still valuable to get a taste of the process.
        * While learners are testing the levels, take this time to collect USB's and get ready for the 'Game Release'

            </tr>
            </table>

        <br>
        #Game Release

        * <strong>Before</strong>: Collect all of the team USBs - Be sure to download the opening audio track (and any other ones created) to play for the group
        * Instruct everyone to wrap up what they are working on and close their laptops
        * Play the opening audio track to kick-off the game release
        * Open up the Scratch Class Studio and briefly Demo each level for everyone (Optional: Have learners volunteer to help demo each level)
        * Play any closing audio tracks (if applicable)
        * <strong>Reflection</strong>: Use Slide 38 to reflect on what we learned
        * Use Slide 39 to draw attention to anything that was missed

        <br>
        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        <br>

      Welcome to our Girls Learning Code workshop: Collaborative Game Production! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

      How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
      (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

      We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

      Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

      * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please go with another learner (or your parent/guaridan).
      * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it.
      * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a break mid-way through, when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

      #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

      If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.
