        #Using Scratch

        Scratch is a great tool for teaching coding concepts, and building fun and creative digital games. If you aren’t familiar with the program: great news! There are tons of free, online resources to get you started. Here are a few that we think are awesome:

        * Scratch <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/#resources">Educator Resources</a> (especially the <a href="https://cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__0c1805349a6fe15c01c668d3f8acd971__/pdfs/help/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf">Getting Started Guide</a>)
        * Google CS First <a href="https://www.cs-first.com/training/introduction-computer-science-and-scratch">Training Materials</a>

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Girls Learning Code workshop: Collaborative Game Production! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our programs before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them which ones they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then - since we had so many people asking if boys could come too - we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        <!--* <strong>Acknowledgement of Traditional Lands</strong>: “I would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is the traditional territory of __ (nations). I would also like to recognize the enduring presence of Aboriginal peoples on this land.”-->

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located, and if they are gender-neutral). If you need to go to the washroom, please go with your parent/guaridan or another learner.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it.
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a break mid-way through, when you can eat any *peanut free* snacks you brought along, or just stretch your legs. Please clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

              <br><br><strong>Declining Bee Population</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Who is affected</strong>: Farmers, Everyone (1/3 of all of our food depends on bees to pollinate) </li>
                  <li><strong>Where is this taking place?</strong>: Globally, especially North America and Europe</li>
                  <li><strong>When did this start to be a problem?</strong>: Since the late 1990s, beekeepers around the world have observed the mysterious and sudden disappearance of bees (& report unusually high rates of decline in honeybee colonies - the rusty patched bumblebee is now an endangered species)</li>
                  <li><strong>Why is this happening?</strong>: Climate change (temperature, rainfall patterns), Loss of biodiversity, Pesticide / industrial agriculture, Parasites/disease (more susceptible - pesticide lowers immune system), Insecticide</li>
                  <li><strong>What can people do to help?</strong>: Plant wildflowers (a well-manicured lawn is like a desert to them, and some bees have a more specific diet, so less biodiversity mean being unable to survive), Ecological farming systems, Ban dangerous pesticide and avoid pesticides in your garden, Preserve wild habitats, Buy regional and organic food</li>
                </ul>

                <br><br>*Have learners turn to 2-3 elbow partners and brainstorm ideas for how to remix the "Catch Em" game.
                <br><br>Put up a timer for 1-2 minutes (timer-tab.com). Before having them share with the entire group - go to the next slide to explain what a GDD is.*

              <td>A Game Design Document or GDD is how we will keep track of the ideas for our game.
              <br><br> Q: Why does a GDD need to be "living" or changing?
              <br>A: As we create our game, we might change our mind, have another idea we want to add in, or come across an issue that results in changing a part of our game. This is completely normal!
              </td>

              <td>*Use a white board or anchor chart paper and markers to create your GDD with the group. Write <strong>Players, Rules, Goals, Title</strong> on the board.
              <br><br>Have each group share their idea(s) from the Think-Pair-Share activity on what our game could look like.
              <br><br>When someone has an idea, write it on the board. If the same idea is repeated, circle or underline it.
              <br><br>Be sure to answer each of these questions together. Feel free to have the group vote or make an executive decision to save time.
              <br><br> If you have trouble coming up with ideas, here is an example GDD for the Declining Bee Population theme:*

        #Tech Stations: Group 1

        * Review the checklist of what will be completed at this station
        * Pair learners and assign each pair a level number (1 laptop per pair)
        * Instruct each pair to create an account in scratch using the instructions on Slide 27
        * <strong>Have pairs record their login info for the next group</strong>
        * Quick Code-Along:
          * Open up Scratch, and click on “create” (top, left corner)
          * Point out the main elements: Stage, Sprites, and Scripts. Demonstrate how to drag and connect blocks
          * Give learners 2 minutes to click on blocks and explore
        * Follow the <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AQNH-EQUEVi8GGe_lpqPpLaNOU2F5Rx0u0srs5nB-k0">solution sheet</a></strong> as you lead the group in creating a working foundation, stopping right after "Falling Obstacles"
        * <strong>Tip</strong>: If the room is too loud - have learners leave their computers and come stand/sit right in front of the screen for each chunk of instructions
        * If you run out of time, continue where you left off with the second group
        * Make sure everyone clicks on "SHARE" when they are finished (top, right corner)
        * Have learners add their projects to the studio (Go to "My Class" > Select studio > Add Projects) - See slide 28
        * <strong>For the 2nd rotation: Split the group at your station into two even groups (or as close as your can get). Direct the group closest to the Audio station to rotate there, and the Artworks station, there.</strong>

        <strong style="color:#763dff;"> NOTE: If the internet is not working, have mentors help download the Scratch Offline Editor using the Contingency USB's. You will also need to use the USB's to save and share projects with the second group.</strong>

        <br>
        #Tech Stations: Group 2

        * Review the checklist of what will be completed at this station
        * Pair learners and assign each pair a level number (1 laptop per pair)
        * Instruct learners to sign in with the logins recorded from the first group
        * Quick Code-Along: (in a blank project)
          * Open up Scratch, and click on “create” (top, left corner)
          * Point out the main elements: Stage, Sprites, and Scripts. Demonstrate how to drag and connect blocks
          * Give learners 2 minutes to click on blocks and explore
        * Show them how to continue a project using the instructions on Slide 32
        * Follow the <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AQNH-EQUEVi8GGe_lpqPpLaNOU2F5Rx0u0srs5nB-k0">solution sheet</a></strong> as you lead the group in continuing their levels, picking up where the last group left off, and completing as much of the checklist as you can.
        * <strong>Tip</strong>: If the room is too loud - have learners leave their computers and come stand/sit right in front of the screen for each chunk of instructions


        <br>
        #Beta Testing

        * Get everyone's attention and have them wrap up what they are doing at their station
        * Use the slides to explain beta testing (see notes below)
        * Explain that we will be focused on playing/testing the levels - we might not have time to fix every bug, but it's still valuable to get a taste of the process.
        * While learners are testing the levels, take this time to to prepare for the 'Game Release'. <strong>Collect all of the team USB's</strong> and download the opening audio track and promo materials - created at the Audio and Artworks stations.

        #Game Release

        * Instruct everyone to wrap up what they are working on and close their laptops
        * Play the opening audio track to kick-off the game release
        * Show 1-2 of the promotional materials from the Artworks station (more, if time)
        * Open up the Scratch Class Studio and briefly Demo each level for everyone (Optional: Have 1-2 learners volunteer to help you out)
        * Play any closing audio tracks (if applicable)
        * <strong>Reflection</strong>: Use Slide 38 to reflect on what we learned
        * Use Slide 39 to draw attention to anything that was missed

        <br>
        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run.

      #Introduction

      Welcome to our Girls Learning Code workshop: Collaborative Game Production! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

      How many of you have been to one of our programs before?
      (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them which ones they attended)

      We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then - since we had so many people asking if boys could come too - we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

      Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

      <!--* <strong>Acknowledgement of Traditional Lands</strong>: “I would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is the traditional territory of __ (nations). I would also like to recognize the enduring presence of Aboriginal peoples on this land.”-->

      * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located, and if they are gender-neutral). If you need to go to the washroom, please go with your parent/guaridan or another learner.
      * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it.
      * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a break mid-way through, when you can eat any *peanut free* snacks you brought along, or just stretch your legs. Please clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

                <li><strong>Who is affected</strong>: Farmers, Everyone (1/3 of all of our food depends on bees to pollinate) </li>
                <li><strong>Where is this taking place?</strong>: Globally, especially North America and Europe</li>
                <li><strong>When did this start to be a problem?</strong>: Since the late 1990s, beekeepers around the world have observed the mysterious and sudden disappearance of bees (& report unusually high rates of decline in honeybee colonies - the rusty patched bumblebee is now an endangered species)</li>
                <li><strong>Why is this happening?</strong>: Climate change (temperature, rainfall patterns), Loss of biodiversity, Pesticide / industrial agriculture, Parasites/disease (more susceptible - pesticide lowers immune system), Insecticide</li>
                <li><strong>What can people do to help?</strong>: Plant wildflowers (a well-manicured lawn is like a desert to them, and some bees have a more specific diet, so less biodiversity mean being unable to survive), Ecological farming systems, Ban dangerous pesticide and avoid pesticides in your garden, Preserve wild habitats, Buy regional and organic food</li>
              </ul>
            </td>

              <br><br>*Have learners turn to 2-3 elbow partners and brainstorm ideas for how to remix the "Catch Em" game.
              <br><br>Put up a timer for 1-2 minutes (timer-tab.com). Before having them share with the entire group - go to the next slide to explain what a GDD is.*

            <td>A Game Design Document or GDD is how we will keep track of the ideas for our game.
            <br><br> Q: Why does a GDD need to be "living" or changing?
            <br>A: As we create our game, we might change our mind, have another idea we want to add in, or come across an issue that results in changing a part of our game. This is completely normal!

            <br><br>Have each group share their idea(s) from the Think-Pair-Share activity on what our game could look like.
            <br><br>When someone has an idea, write it on the board. If the same idea is repeated, circle or underline it.

      #Tech Stations: Group 1

      * Review the checklist of what will be completed at this station
      * Pair learners and assign each pair a level number (1 laptop per pair)
      * Instruct each pair to create an account in scratch using the instructions on Slide 27
      * <strong>Have pairs record their login info for the next group</strong>
      * Quick Code-Along:
        * Open up Scratch, and click on “create” (top, left corner)
        * Point out the main elements: Stage, Sprites, and Scripts. Demonstrate how to drag and connect blocks
        * Give learners 2 minutes to click on blocks and explore
      * Follow the <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AQNH-EQUEVi8GGe_lpqPpLaNOU2F5Rx0u0srs5nB-k0">solution sheet</a></strong> as you lead the group in creating a working foundation, stopping right after "Falling Obstacles"
      * <strong>Tip</strong>: If the room is too loud - have learners leave their computers and come stand/sit right in front of the screen for each chunk of instructions
      * If you run out of time, continue where you left off with the second group
      * Make sure everyone clicks on "SHARE" when they are finished (top, right corner)
      * Have learners add their projects to the studio (Go to "My Class" > Select studio > Add Projects) - See slide 28
      * <strong>For the 2nd rotation: Split the group at your station into two even groups (or as close as your can get). Direct the group closest to the Audio station to rotate there, and the Artworks station, there.</strong>

      <strong style="color:#763dff;"> NOTE: If the internet is not working, have mentors help download the Scratch Offline Editor using the Contingency USB's. You will also need to use the USB's to save and share projects with the second group.</strong>
